# About

This is a technical interview template created by Fernando Gomes.

This template is intended to be part of validating the candidate's technical skills, but perhaps it could also touch on some soft skills.
Usually an HR person is present to ask the philosophical questions, working processes, contract and everything.
It's common to have separate meetings to talk about other things, and just focus now on just the tech stuff.

These steps are more focused on Backend using Java and micro services but also can be used in Kotlin, NodeJS and other similar tech and approaches.

In parts, it can also be used for Front or FullStack interviews.

Suggested duration:
- For Junior: 30-60 min
- For Mid level: 45-60 min
- For Seniors: 60-90min
- For Specialist/Architect/Lead: 90-120 min

Tips:
- Bring the team to the process. Discuss with other members what you should ask and validate.
- Do it in Pairs, it can be very Helpful to analyze the candidate and also to have more people in the interview meeting. It can help the candidate to feel comfortable. Just take care to not ask too many questions (double) and be aligned.

## Greetings

Good morning/afternoon;

First of all, thank you for your time and availability to be here with us.

Add some icebreaker, talk about cool stuff, maybe about the location, or some random fun facts.

## About the schedule

Explain how it will be conducted;

How many blocks, phases, how long will take each part;

When the candidate will be able to ask questions;

If there is some code challenge;

## About the candidate

If you can please talk a little bit about yourself and your background, very briefly focusing on your most recent experiences.

Preferably, take a look at the candidate's resume or LinkedIn profile some time before the interview.

Prepare some specific questions, pay attention when the candidate talks about their background, and try to make a correlation with the resume.

## Some possible direct questions to ask

I always prefer to choose the questions and order based on and linked to the candidate experience and history that was told some minutes before.

Also consider the preview analyzed level or applied level of the candidate.

I really believe it's better to have a fluid conversation and perhaps touch on some of these questions through fluid conversation rather than just following an inquiry and hoping for the best and most accurate theoretical answers.
